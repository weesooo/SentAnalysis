Sentiment Analysis - Python

We want to analyze the sentiment of the text on the sentence level. That is, we want to classify each sentence in this text as having either positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. The following three sentences illustrate each sentiment type. For example, 

I am so excited about my new car. (Positive sentiment)

I feel tired and moody today. (Negative sentiment)

There is parked car on the street. (Neutral sentiment)

If more words in a sentence carry the positive sentiment than negative, we will classify that sentence as having a positive sentiment. If the number of positive and
negative words in a sentence is equal, we will classify that sentence as neutral. Otherwise, the sentence is classified as having a negative sentiment.
